# School_District_Analysis.

## Overview of the school district analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to re-create our district analysis while removing the reading and math scores from Thomas High School -grade 9 due to suspected academic dishonesty. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

  - How is the district summary affected?
        The district summary had small differences in the percentage of students who passed either math or reading and a .3 % decrease on the number          of students who passed both.

  - How is the school summary affected?

  - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? 
        There was not enough of a difference to change the rankings vs. other schools
  
  - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    
      - Math and reading scores by grade
          The only difference in this is that fact that the Thomas High School 9th Grade cell now contains NaN
      
      - Scores by school spending, school size, or school type
          There was not enough of a difference in the scores to impact the scores by school spending, school size or school type.

## Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
